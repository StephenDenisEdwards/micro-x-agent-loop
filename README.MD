# micro-x-agent-loop

A lightweight autonomous AI agent loop, starting simple and evolving toward a full-featured personal AI assistant inspired by [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw).

## About

This project begins as a minimal agent loop — the core cycle of perceiving, reasoning, and acting that underpins autonomous AI agents. The goal is to build a solid foundation first, then incrementally add capabilities to approach the functionality of projects like OpenClaw: an open-source autonomous agent that executes real-world tasks via LLMs across multiple platforms and integrations.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1 — Simple Agent Loop
- Basic prompt-response loop with an LLM
- Tool/action execution framework
- Simple memory and context management

### Phase 2 — Skills & Integrations
- Plugin/skill system for extensible capabilities
- File system, web browsing, and command execution skills
- Multi-model support

### Phase 3 — Multi-Platform & Autonomy
- Messaging platform integrations (Slack, Discord, Telegram, etc.)
- Autonomous task planning and execution
- Permission and safety controls

## Getting Started
